## Smalllists 

### 💻 Description:
Small lists is a React application. It functions as a shopping list - or anything list -, that you can add items inside a category, and mark them as done, or delete them. You can also share via your preferred way to any friend of yours to check the list. The sharing button creates a url with your complete list and when you share it the application quickly fetches all data from the url to recreate the list on a different device. When this process is done, the url switches back to the standard way.
